slots:
  cell set accession:
    description: >-
      Primary identifier for cell set.
  cell type name:
    description: >-
      The primary name/symbol to be used for the cell type defined by this cell set.
    aliases: [ "primary_cell_type_alias" ] #todo: alliases can be used for ccn1_mapping? doesn't show in json
  parent cell set accession:
    description: >-
      The cell set accession of the parent cell set in the taxonomy. This field should be programmatically assigned, not edited.
  synonyms:
    description: >-  #
      A list of alternative names for this cell type. Separate entries with a '|'. Do not use terms with a scope that is much narrower or broader than the cell type being described.
  synonym provenance:
    description: >-
      Each entry in the synonyms field should have a corresponding entry here, either the DOI of a supporting publication (in the form the form doi:10.1126/journal.abj6641) or the editor's ORCID (in the form: ORCID:01243-234-678). Multiple entries should be separated by a '|'.
  description:
    description: >-
      Optional free text description of the cluster. This could be particularly useful for describing the properties of cells clustered from techniques that provide data on morphology, function and connectivity, e.g. patch-seq & epi-retro-seq.
  classifying ontology term id:
    description: >-
      The ID of an ontology term that classifies the cell type defined by this node.
  classifying ontology term name:
    description: >-
      The name of the ontology term in the classification_id column
  classification provenance:
    description: >-
      Either the DOI(s) of a supporting publication (in the form the form doi:10.1126/journal.abj6641) or the editor's ORCID (in the form: ORCID:01243-234-678). Multiple entries should be separated by a '|'.
  classification comment:
    description: >-
      A free text comment describing the evidence for this classification.
  rank:
    description: >-
      Algorithmically generated hierarchical taxonomies can be complex, with many nodes between root and leaf and branches of variable depth. To simplify this for display and discussion it can be useful to assign nodes to a 3 level hierarchy, with leaf nodes at the bottom.
    range: Rank
  mapped cell set accession:
    description: >-
      The accession (ID) of a cell set in a second taxonomy that this cell set maps to.
  mapped cell type name:
    description: >-
      The name of the cell type corresponding to the mapped_cell_set_accession.
  evidence comment:
    description: >-
      A free text description of the evidence.
  similarity score:
    description: >-
      A score recording the similarity between mapped nodes.
    range: float
    minimum_value: 0
    maximum_value: 1
  provenance:
    description: >-
      ORCID of the person doing the mapping using the syntax ORCID:0123-4567-890. Optionally include supporting publications using DOIs of the form doi:10.1126/journal.abj6641.
  location ontology term id:
    description: >-
      The ID of an ontology term that refers to a brain region that this cell type is located in. Ideally this should be the ID of a term defined as a region in a standard atlas.
  location ontology term name:
    description: >-
      Name of the term whose ID is recorded in the ontology_term_id field.
  supporting data:
    description: >-
      A link to data supporting this location mapping.
  sample:
    description: >-
      Cell sample identifier.
  cell accessions:
    description: >-
      List of cell set accession identifiers.
